For our Senior Capstone Project we decided to make a top-down view, 2-D game based off the popular anime Goblin Slayer. 
The game is a hack and slash survival game where the player will slay a set amount of creatures.
After slaying a certain amount of creatures the player will then move up in level which will increase the difficulty the longer you survive.
The longer you survive, the more creatures there will be for you to slay.
The creatures will get harder to slay and spawn quicker the longer you survive.
