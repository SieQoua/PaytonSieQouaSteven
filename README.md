Game Description

For our Senior Capstone Project we decided to develop a top-down view, 2-D game based off the popular anime "Goblin Slayer" using C# on VisualStudios.
All the animations and codes will then be processed through an application called Unity. 
Unity is a development platform that we will be using to help us develop this game.
The game is a hack and slash survival game where the player will slay a certain amount of creatures.
After slaying a certain amount of creatures the player will then move up in level.
The creatures will start to appear quicker and become much harder to slay as the game progresses.

Current Progress 
As of right now we have a variety of sprites created for the game. 
As for our code, so far we have been able to incorprate movement for our main player.
